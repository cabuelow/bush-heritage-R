# TODO

- [ ] Decide on course structure/topics
- [ ] Write notes
- [ ] ....

Every thing below just brainstroming.....

## Intro course (1 Day)

Draft outline

1. Getting data into R, RProjects, naming things
2. Plotting your data
3. Cleaning and wrangling your data
    - Do we do loops/functions in intro day?
    - long vs. wide format data
4. Simple analysis/summary stats?? How deep do we go in intro - maybe a simple linear model testing for differences between sites?

## Advanced Course (2 Days)

### Day 1 - Spatial analysis/SDMs

Draft outline

1. Using R as a GIS
2. Building a spatial model
3. Mapping model output
4. ...multivariate?

### Day 2 - Shiny apps/dashboards, advanced data wrangling (?)

Somebody asked about doing a population model - could build a shiny app/dashboard around that and also showcase advanced data wrangling?

Alt. build a shiny app to showcase summary stats/info Bush Heritage will want to routinely display and update?
