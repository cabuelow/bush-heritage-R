    "text": "Hello!\nWe’re very much looking forward to our 3 days of R’ing with you (July 23rd - 25th).\nIn preparation, please install R and RStudio. See Section 0.1.3 for instructions.\nOnce you have RStudio up and running, please install the following R packages. You can just copy and paste the code below into the console of RStudio and hit enter to install.\n\nDay 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation in R\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"here\", \"lubridate\", \"lme4\", \"ggplot2\", \"patchwork\"))\n\n\n\nDay 2 & 3 - Statistical Modelling in R\n\ninstall.packages(c('ggplot2', 'patchwork', 'DHARMa', 'MASS', 'Hmsc', 'sf', 'terra', 'tidyr', 'vegan', 'dplyr', 'ggcorrplot', 'fields'))\n\n\nremotes::install_version(\"tmap\", \"3.3-4\")\n\nYou’re also welcome to peruse the course notes linked to in the tabs above, but note that these are subject to change up until day of the course.\nCheers,\nChristina, Caitie and Jackson\n\n\nInstalling R and RStudio\n\nWindows\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nRun the .exe file that was just downloaded\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder All Installers, download the RStudio Installer for Windows.\nDouble click the file to install it\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\nMacOS\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder All Installers, download the RStudio Installer for MacOS.\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nFollow the instructions for your distribution from CRAN, they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base, and for Fedora sudo yum install R), but we don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder All Installers, select the version that matches your distribution and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu sudo dpkg -i rstudio-YYYY.MM.X-ZZZ-amd64.deb at the terminal).\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating R and RStudio\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed, first check if your R version is up to date:\n\nWhen you open RStudio your R version will be printed in the console on the bottom left. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo() into the console. If your R version is 4.0.0 or later, you don’t need to update R for this lesson. If your version of R is older than that, download and install the latest version of R from the R project website for Windows, for MacOS, or for Linux\nIt is not necessary to remove old versions of R from your system, but if you wish to do so you can check How do I uninstall R?\nNote: The changes introduced by new R versions are usually backwards-compatible. That is, your old code should still work after updating your R version. However, if breaking changes happen, it is useful to know that you can have multiple versions of R installed in parallel and that you can switch between them in RStudio by going to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; General &gt; Basic.\nAfter installing a new version of R, you will have to reinstall all your packages with the new version. For Windows, there is a package called installr that can help you with upgrading your R version and migrate your package library.\n\nTo update RStudio to the latest version, open RStudio and click on Help &gt; Check for Updates. If a new version is available follow the instruction on screen. By default, RStudio will also automatically notify you of new versions every once in a while."

    "text": "Dr Christina Buelow\nDr Christina Buelow is a quantitative ecologist who loves data and models. She got her start as a field ecologist, but these days she spends most of her time behind a computer developing models and tools to solve challenging problems related to conservation and sustainable use of Earth’s ecosystems. Currently, she is working closely with international NGOs to inform climate-smart conservation of coastal ecosystems.\n\n\nDr Caite Kuempel\nDr Caitie Kuempel is a marine ecologist turned quantitative modeler. She leads the Conservation Action Team at Griffith University. Her research synthesises new and existing data to quantify the what and where of human impacts on biodiversity from local to global scales and the actions that can be taken to reduce these threats. Her work largely falls within four main themes: 1) cumulative impacts of human activities, 2) spatial conservation planning, 3) land-sea interactions and 4) achieving conservation targets. This work can be used to quantify patterns between different locations, assess trade-offs between management actions, and inform conservation and sustainable development decisions.\n\n\nDr Jackson Stockbridge\nDr Jackson Stockbridge is a quantitative marine ecologist working on a marine spatial planning framework to inform ocean management. This involves using spatial data to map ocean uses, and the cumulative impact of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems. Having grown up in the UK, he moved to Adelaide South Australia to undertake a bachelor’s degree in marine biology. He then went on to complete his PhD, where he evaluated common assumptions of methods to calculate the impact of multiple stressors on marine environments. Her is currently a post-doctoral fellow as part of the Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre Marine Spatial Planning project where he is constructing frameworks and analysis to better integrate cumulative impacts in offshore Blue Economy planning and development."
