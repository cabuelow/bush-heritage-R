## Dr Christina Buelow

[Dr Christina Buelow](https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/){target="_blank"} is a quantitative ecologist who loves data and models. She got her start as a field ecologist, but these days she spends most of her time behind a computer developing models and tools to solve challenging problems related to conservation and sustainable use of Earth's ecosystems. Currently, she is working closely with international NGOs to inform climate-smart conservation of coastal ecosystems. Although the website is still under construction, you can find out more about her work [here](https://cabuelow.github.io/personal-website/){target="_blank"}.
