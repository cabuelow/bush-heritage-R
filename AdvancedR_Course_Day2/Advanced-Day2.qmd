# Welcome

## General(ised) linear models in a Bayesian framework


## Day 1 (Afternoon): Complex multivariate models

-   Bayesian glm (univariate) - start with same species richness example from previous day,

-   Bayesian parameter estimation

-   max likelihood to MCMC sampling

-   Why Bayesian? complex models (e.g., spatial random effects), low sample size and prior information

-   multivariate GLM (or wait till day 2 and make it a spatial example?)

- do a presence absence example
Day 2 (Morning): Spatial models Day 2 (Afternoon): Interactive dashboard
