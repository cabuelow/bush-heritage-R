This project contains preprocessing scripts for data obtained from the following methods:

M04.020 Soil Surface Quadrat
M06.040 Recruitment
M06.07x Tree Health Quadrat
M06.080 Vegetation Quadrat
M06.090 Vegetation Transect

The scripts are intended to be run interactively and iteratively, rather than as a block, with the ecologist selecting whether or not to run individual sections based on their requirements.

Code is included to plot data in a variety of ways for diagnostic or reporting purposes. Preprocessed data is stored in Tidyverse data frames (tibbles) which can form the basis for further analysis where supported by the data.
