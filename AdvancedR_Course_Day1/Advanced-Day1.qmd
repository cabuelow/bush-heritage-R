# Statistical modelling in R for ecologists

Whenever you embark on a journey in statistical modelling, it's good to be reminded of the following quote from *George E.P. Box*,

**All models are wrong, but some are useful**.

We build models to help us understand ecological relationships. But no model is perfect. Ecological data in particular is fraught with a lot of random, natural variation in observations that our models will be unable to explain. 

Modelling goals can be three-fold: 

  1. **Exploration**, e.g. which environmental variables are associated with species richness?,
  
  2. **Inference**, e.g., do protected areas cause increased species richness?,
  
  3. **Prediction**, e.g., use correlations between environmental variables and species abundance to predict species habitat suitability across space.

How we build and select models depends on our goals for the analysis. Check out this great guide to [goal driven model selection in ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.3336)

Here, we will focus primarily on building exploratory and predictive models. Causal inference is beyond the scope, but see this great guide for ecologists [insert Arif paper]

This course assumes an understanding of how to wrangle, summarise, and visualise data in **R**. We hope you will learn:

  - The fundamentals of fitting statistical models to data,
  
  - how to check your model fits the data well, and
  
  - how to visualise model output in **R**.

## Linear models

### General linear models

Example: Tree health dataset - species circumference as indication of age?
   - Expect older trees in less disturbed sites?
   - Can use a lm to test

### Frequentist glm - Tree health or Vegetation quadrat 
  - Species richness - is species richness higher in less disturbed sites?
  - Use glm to test
  
- OLS to max likelihoood
- Model checking - residuals
- Plotting and reporting model output

## Day 1 (Afternoon): Complex multivariate models

- Bayesian glm (univariate) - start with same species richness example from previous day, or 
- Bayesian parameter estimation
- max likelihood to MCMC sampling
- Why Bayesian? complex models (e.g., spatial random effects), low sample size and prior information

- multivariate GLM (or wait till day 2 and make it a spatial example?)
