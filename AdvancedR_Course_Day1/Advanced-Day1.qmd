# Statistical modelling in R for ecologists

## Day 1 (Morning): Simple linear models

### Frequentist lm

Example: Tree health dataset - species circumference as indication of age?
   - Expect older trees in less disturbed sites?
   - Can use a lm to test

### Frequentist glm - Tree health or Vegetation quadrat 
  - Species richness - is species richness higher in less disturbed sites?
  - Use glm to test
  
- OLS to max likelihoood
- Model checking - residuals

## Day 1 (Afternoon): Complex multivariate models

- Bayesian glm (univariate)
- Bayesian parameter estimation
- max likelihood to MCMC sampling
- Why Bayesian? complex models (e.g., spatial random effects), low sample size and prior information

- multivariate GLM (or wait till day 2 and make it a spatial example?)
