# Welcome

Day 1 (Morning): Simple linear models

- Frequentist lm
- Frequentist glm
- OLS to max likelihoood
- Model checking - residuals

Day 1 (Afternoon): Complex multivariate models

- Bayesian glm (univariate)
- Bayesian parameter estimation
- max likelihood to MCMC sampling
- Why Bayesian? complex models (e.g., spatial random effects), low sample size and prior information

- multivariate GLM (or wait till day 2 and make it a spatial example?)
